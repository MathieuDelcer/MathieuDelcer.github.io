## Project Context
I want to use my printer, **Canon Laser Shot LBP-1120**, with my Windows 10 PCs. However, the drivers are only available for Windows 7 32-bit, making it impossible to use on modern operating systems natively. To solve this, I will repurpose my leftover Raspberry Pi as a print server, allowing me to use the printer again. Luckily, someone made a driver for this, and there is also a guide available.

# Raspberry Pi - Canon LBP-1120 Printer Setup

## 1. Initialize Your Raspberry Pi
1. Use the official Raspbian image or Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi and install it on your microSD card using **Raspberry Pi Imager**.
2. Configure your Pi's network:
   - Use a **static IP address** (set it either on your Pi or your router).
3. Change the **user and root passwords** for security.

---

## 2. Update and Install Required Packages
Run the following commands to update your system and install necessary packages:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install cups build-essential gcc
```

---

## 3. Install the Printer Driver on Your Raspberry Pi
1. Copy the `capt` directory to `/usr/src/`.
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd /usr/src/capt
   make
   ```
3. Log in as root and install the driver:
   ```bash
   make install
   modprobe usblp
   ```
4. A new device should appear at `/dev/usb/lp0`. Adjust permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod a+rw /dev/usb/lp0
   ```

---

## 4. Configure CUPS (Common Unix Printing System)
1. Add your user to the `lpadmin` group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G lpadmin <username>
   ```
2. Allow remote access to CUPS:
   ```bash
   sudo cupsctl --remote-any
   ```
3. Restart the CUPS service:
   ```bash
   /etc/init.d/cups restart
   ```

---

## 5. Add the Printer via the CUPS Web Interface
1. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://<your-pi-IP-address>:631/
   ```
2. Follow these steps:
   - **Go to:** `Administration` > `Add Printer`
   - **Select:** LBP printer
   - **Tick:** "Share this printer"
   - **Use driver:** `LBP-810 Foomatic/capt`
   - **Set** the miscellaneous tab to `alwaysReset`

---

## 6. Edit CUPS Configuration File
1. Open the CUPS printer configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/cups/printers.conf
   ```
2. Locate the line:
   ```
   DeviceURI usb://Canon/LASER%20SHOT%20LBP-1120?serial=0158030E
   ```
3. Replace it with:
   ```
   DeviceURI serial:/dev/null
   ```
4. Restart CUPS:
   ```bash
   /etc/init.d/cups restart
   ```
5. You can now add the printer to your computer over your private network.
